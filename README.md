# Numerical Methods Uni Course

This repository contains all of my homework assignments,
completed during my university course on Numerical Methods.

Everything is stored in Jupiter Notebook format because it is very convenient
to prototype and write out some basic mathematical formulas at the same time.

All homework assignments are in the [file](tasks.pdf),
where everyone could find some additional tasks to experiment with.

The themes of assignments are as follows:
1. [Lagrange interpolation](interpolation.ipynb)
2. [Numerical differentiation](differentiation.ipynb)
3. [Numerical intergration](integration.ipynb)
4. [Numerically solving equations](equations.ipynb)
5. [Numerically solving initial value problem (Cauchy problem)](initial_value_problem.ipynb)
6. [Numerically solving boundary value problem](boundary_value_problem.ipynb)
7. [Numerically solving mixed boundary value problem](mixed_boundary_value_problem.ipynb)
